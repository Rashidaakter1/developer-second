                Here I want to write about Self-Introduction Tips and Tricks (with Examples)
            </p>
            <p>
                A good introduction will help new acquaintances learn the essential details about who you are. When you don’t have a third party to provide an introduction, you must offer an informative self-introduction that’s engaging and memorable. The right introduction can solidify your name and purpose for the person you’re speaking to, so you can make a positive impression. This article will help you create a powerful self-introduction that includes all the essential information you need to convey.
            </p>
            <h1>
                What is a self-introduction?
            </h1>
            <p>
                A self-introduction explains who you are, what you do and what others need to know about you. You should provide a self-introduction any time you meet someone new and don’t have a third party to introduce you. Offer a self-introduction when you are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Beginning an interview
                </li>
                <li>Attending a hiring event</li>
                <li>Networking with new connections</li>
                <li>Giving a presentation</li>
                <li>Meeting people at a trade show</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A self-introduction should include your name and occupation (or desired occupation) and key facts that will help you make an impression on the person you’re speaking to. In a few sentences, cover the most important things that others need to know about you.
            </p>
